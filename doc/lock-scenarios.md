# Equality Explorer - Lock feature scenarios

The lock feature is deceptively complicated, involving many scenarios. This document describes the most basic set of
scenarios. It's highly recommended to use this set of scenarios as a baseline for regression testing. For extra credit,
make up your own variations and use multitouch.

Issue [phetsims/equality-explorer#19](https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/issues/19) contains the original
discussion and (incomplete) specification of the lock feature.

Relevant terminology
from [implementation-notes.md](https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/blob/main/doc/implementation-notes.md#terminology):

* dragged term - the term that you're dragging
* equivalent term - the term on the opposite side of the scale that is identical to the dragged term
* inverse term - a term created on the opposite side of the scale that is the inverse of the dragged term, and is paired
  with the equivalent term
* plate - the balance scale has 2 of these, one for each side of the equation
* opposite plate - the plate associated with the equivalent term, opposite the dragged term
* toolbox - panel that appears below a plate, terms can be dragged to/from

In all scenarios:

* start with an empty scale, unless otherwise indicated
* equivalent term should follow dragged term during dragging and animation
* dragged term and equivalent term should be put on plates simultaneously
* equivalent term should not be draggable, or interact with other terms
* inverse term should be draggable, and doing so will break the association to the equivalent term

## Separate Like Terms

The first 15 scenarios involve screens where like terms are placed in separate cells on the scale. Those screens are
_Numbers_ and _Variables_, and you may use either of those screens to test theses scenarios. Scenarios 1-5 involve
dragging a term from a toolbox. Scenarios 6-15 involve dragging a term from a plate.

### Scenario 1

1. Turn the lock on.
2. Drag an term from the left toolbox.
3. Verify that an equivalent term comes out of the right toolbox and follows the dragged term.
4. Release the dragged term below the plates.
5. Verify that the dragged term and equivalent term return to their respective toolboxes.

### Scenario 2

1. Fill one of the plates with terms.
2. Turn the lock on.
3. On the side of the scale with a full plate, drag a term from a toolbox.
