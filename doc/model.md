# Equality Explorer - model description

This is a high-level description of the model used in Equality Explorer. It's intended for audiences
that are not necessarily technical.

Equality Explorer allows the student to build equations and inequalities (herein referred to as _equations_) by placing _terms_ on a _balance scale_. The scale has a finite number of _cells_ in which to place terms. The 2 sides of the scale correspond to the 2 sides of the equation, which is shown above the scale.  

There are 2 modes of operation when building equations:

(1) Like terms occupy separate cells on the scale, and can be combined only if they sum to zero. This is the mode of operation in the _Basics_, _Numbers_ and _Variables_ screens.

(2) Like terms are combined in one cell on the scale.  This is the mode of operation in the _Operations_ and _Solve It!_ screens.

The _Variables_ screen introduces the variable _x_, and the abiltiy to change its value.

The _Operations_ screen introduces the ability to apply _operations_ to both sides of the scale. An operation consists of an _operator_ and an _operand_. The operators are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  The operands are constant and variable terms.  Constant terms have a range of -10 to 10.  Variable terms involve the variable _x_, with a coefficient range of -10 to 10.  Multiplication and division are supported for constant terms only. Division by zero is not allowed.
