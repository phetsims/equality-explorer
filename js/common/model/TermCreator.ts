/**
 * TermCreator is the abstract base type for creating and managing terms.
 *
 * Terms can be created in 3 ways:
 * - by dragging them out of a toolbox below a plate
 * - by restoring a snapshot
 * - by using the 'universal operation' control.
 *
 * TermCreators operate in one of two modes, based on the value of {boolean} this.combineLikeTermsEnabled:
 * true: each term *type* occupies one cell on the scale, and all like terms are combined
 * false: each term *instance* occupies one cell on the scale, and terms are combined only if they sum to zero
 *
 * See https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/blob/main/doc/implementation-notes.md
 * for a detailed description of how the PhET 'creator pattern' is applied in this simulation.
 *
 * Note that TermCreator is not involved with Terms that are created for snapshots. Those terms are created
 * and managed by Snapshot. See https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/issues/199
