DESIGN QUESTIONS

Reconsider "white box" feature

Solving screen, multi-touch:
- When you start dragging something on one plate, does the corresponding thing on the other plate become non-interactive?
- What happens when universal operation is applied while an item is being dragged?
- What happens when the variable value is changed while the "composite x" item is being dragged?

Should we put a fontawesome lock icon on the scale when coupling is on?

Snapshots UI has usability issues

Solving: When I drop x on a plate, does it turn into a big x? This seems odd (especially if "sum to zero" works here),
but design doc indicates that size of term on the plate does not scale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS

Ghost moves y-proportionally below the plate. Above the plate tracks exactly. x-axis movement is tracked exactly.

Animation of ghost and dragged item occurs such that they arrive at their cells at same time.

If left plate is full, can still drag out of right panel, but items will always fly back to panels.

Item limits: 36 on either plate, any combination, show dialog "left plate full" or "right plate full" in any
situation where need to create a zero-pair and a plate is full

IMPLEMENTATION

Handle remaining cases in https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/issues/17#issuecomment-341774489

Reconsider model architecture. State is spread across ItemCreator and Plate, duplicate info about what is on the Plate.

Consider subtypes instead of constructor comparison, especially in ItemNode (search for ".constructor")

Snapshots
- save and restore the user's arrangement of items on the scale
- save and restore 'x' value
- show 'x=N' in snapshots, based on a new toggle control in the button group

Coupled mode

Solving screen - generalize other screens? different implementation?
