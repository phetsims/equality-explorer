DESIGN QUESTIONS

Reconsider "white box" feature

Solving screen, multi-touch:
- When you start dragging something on one plate, does the corresponding thing on the other plate become non-interactive?
- What happens when universal operation is applied while an item is being dragged?
- What happens when the variable value is changed while the "composite x" item is being dragged?

Should we put a fontawesome lock icon on the scale when coupling is on?

Snapshots UI has usability issues

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS

Ghost moves y-proportionally below the plate. Above the plate tracks exactly. x-axis movement is tracked exactly.

Animation of ghost and dragged item occurs such that they arrive at their cells at same time.

If left plate is full, can still drag out of right panel, but items will always fly back to panels.

Item limits: 36 on either plate, any combination, show dialog "left plate full" or "right plate full" in any
situation where need to create a zero-pair and a plate is full

Be sure to consider scenarios where inverses sum to zero while coupling is enabled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION

Reconsider model architecture. State is spread across ItemCreator and Plate, duplicate info about what is on the Plate.

How to associate inverses? ItemCreator.setInverse?

Combine inverses to create '0', halo, fade out.
if ( item1.constantTerm && item2.constantTerm && item1.weight === -item2.weight ) { combine }
if ( item1.variableTerm && item2.variableTerm && item1.weight === -item2.weight ) { combine }

Item type hierarchy: ConstantItem, VariableItem

Handling of variables and inverses in EquationNode, replace temporary hack

Implement coupled mode

Snapshots
- save and restore the user's arrangement of items on the scale
- save and restore 'x' value
- show 'x=N' in snapshots, based on a new toggle control in the button group
