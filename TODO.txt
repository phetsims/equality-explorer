TODO items for equality-explorer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN

Reconsider "white box" feature

Snapshots: Is position of items on scale saved and restored?

Item limits (proposed by AM in Slack):
On the Variables screen, they can drag up to 8 of any object, so there’s always space for inverses to appear.
On the Numbers screen the limit would be 18
On the Solving screen, there would not be limits

Solving: Since there are no limits, when does the scale "bottom out"?

REQUIREMENTS

Ghost moves y-proportionally below the plate. Above the plate tracks exactly. x-axis movement is tracked exactly.

Animation of ghost and dragged item occurs such that they arrive at their cells at same time.

If left plate is full, can still drag out of right panel, but items will always fly back to panels.

1 and -1 combined to 0, which then fades ala Expression Exchange.
