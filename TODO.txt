TODO items for equality-explorer

========================================================================================================================
DESIGN

Create "Equation Explorer" folder in Google docs (currently "Balancing Equations")

Number the mockups in the design document, so that they can be referred to in comments, emails, etc.

The title is "Equality Explorer" but we are exploring equalities and inequalities. I'm mentioning this because
  we decided that using "Equation" for the accordion box title was incorrect, and we needed "Equation or Inequality".

Basics: What are the 3 scenes, their item types, and the relative "weight" of each item type?

Numbers: Put '1' on the left plate, lock the couplers, then return '1' to the left panel. This results
  in '-1' being added to the right plate.  Does that -1 come from the right panel's supply of '-1'?

Variables: What is the range for the 'x' value spinner? Does it include zero?

Variables: How are we handling 'x' with respect to snapshots?

Solving: design the control for the "universal operation"
  What UI controls does it use?
  What are the operators?
  What is the range of the numeric value?
  Does the range vary based on operator?

Solving: Can the "universal operation" be used to add things to an empty scale? (e.g. "+ 2")

Solving: Is there a limit after which the "universal operator" can't be used? For example, what prevents
  me from pressing "x 5" over and over? How do we determine the size of the items on the scale if
  there is no "maximum"?

Solving: In previous screens, we had a specific number of each item available.
  With the "universal operation", it seems like we need an infinite number of each item.
  E.g., put '10x' on the scale, then apply universal operator 'x 5', which gives us '50x', then
  return that to the panel below the scale.
