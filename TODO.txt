LOCK FEATURE =========

scenarios: term dragged from toolbox, ghost comes out of other toolbox
(1) term released below plate, term and ghost return to toolbox
(2) term released above inverse on plate, term and inverse sum to zero, ghost goes to plate
(3) term released above plate, term plate full (or becomes full), term and ghost return to toolbox
(4) term released above plate, ghost plate full (or becomes full), term and ghost return to toolbox
(5) term released about plate, room on both plates, term and ghost go to plates

scenarios: term dragged from plate, ghost obtained from other plate
(1-5) same behavior as 'from toolbox' above

scenarios: term dragged from plate, ghost must be created and requires creating inverse on other plate
(1) opposite plate is full, don't start term drag, display a dialog with "[left/right] side of balance is full"
(2) term released below plate, term and ghost return to toolbox, inverse remains on plate
(3) term released above plate, term plate full (or becomes full), term and ghost return to toolbox
(4) term released above plate, ghost plate full (or becomes full), term and ghost return to toolbox
(5) term released above plate, room on both plates, term goes to plate, ghost for to plate and replaces inverse

All of the above differently for combining like terms in Operations screen.
