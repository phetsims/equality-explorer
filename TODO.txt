DESIGN QUESTIONS

Solving screen:
- is the organize button relevant? (it's shown in mockups)
- is universal operator visible only when locked?
- multi-touch: When you start dragging something on one plate, does the corresponding thing on the other plate become non-interactive?
- multi-touch: What happens when universal operation is applied while an item is being dragged?
- multi-touch: What happens when x value is changed while an x item is being dragged?

IMPLEMENTATION

Locked mode, #19

Solving screen - generalize other screens? different implementation?

Reset All takes awhile to complete in "Basics" screen, even with nothing on scale (4 scenes)
