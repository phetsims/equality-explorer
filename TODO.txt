TODO items for equality-explorer

========================================================================================================================
DESIGN

August 2017 milestone: which features to include?

Create "Equation Explorer" folder in Google docs (currently "Balancing Equations")

Number the mockups in the design document, so that they can be referred to in comments, emails, etc.

The title is "Equality Explorer" but we are exploring equalities and inequalities. I'm mentioning this because
  we decided that using "Equation" for the accordion box title was incorrect, and should be "Equation or Inequality".

Do we need a control for clearing the scale, as we have in Unit Rates?

Organize button:
  icon?
  disabled when the scale is empty or already organized?
  position it closer to the scale?

Snapshots, what is saved?
  value of x?
  state of accordion boxes?
  state of couplers?

If we have a maximum of 4 items per panel, does that require wider Snapshots panel? Or are some of those items inverses?

Is the state of accordion boxes specific to each scene, or applied to all scenes?

Basics: What are the 3 scenes, their item types, and the relative "weight" of each item type?

Numbers: Put '1' on the left plate, lock the couplers, then return '1' to the left panel. This results
  in '-1' being added to the right plate.  Does that -1 come from the right panel's supply of '-1'?

Variables: What is the range for the 'x' value spinner? Does it include zero?

Variables: How are we handling 'x' with respect to snapshots?

Solving: design the control for the "universal operation"
  What UI controls does it use?
  What are the operators?
  What is the range of the numeric value?
  Does the range vary based on operator?

Solving: Can the "universal operation" be used to add things to an empty scale? (e.g. "+ 2")

Solving: Is there a limit after which the "universal operator" can't be used? For example, what prevents
  me from pressing "x 5" over and over? How do we determine the size of the items on the scale if
  there is no "maximum"?

Solving: In previous screens, we had a specific number of each item available.
  With the "universal operation", it seems like potentially have an infinite number of each item.
  Example scenario: put '10x' on the scale, then apply universal operator 'x 5', which gives us '50x', then
  return that to the panel below the scale. I now have way more items in the panel than I did in the first
  3 screens.
