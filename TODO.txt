DESIGN QUESTIONS

Reconsider "white box" feature

Snapshots: Is position of items on scale saved and restored?

Item limits (proposed by AM in Slack):
Basics: 36 total items, any combination
Variables: 8 (9?) of each item, so there’s always space for inverses to appear.
Numbers: 18 of each item
Solving: no limits

Solving: Since there are no limits, at what weight does the scale "bottom out"?

Variables, Solving: Does changing x cause the scale to move or recalibrate? If the scale does move, then we need
to decide at what weight the scale “bottoms out” and can’t move any more.  x range is [-40,40]. If we choose the
“bottom out weight” to be small (eg, 40), then there will be many scenarios where it’s bottomed out. If we choose
the “bottom out weight” to be large (eg, 400), then there will be many scenarios where putting an item on the
scale results in little perceptible movement of the scale.

Make the scale's arrow 'red' when the scale is bottomed out?

REQUIREMENTS

Ghost moves y-proportionally below the plate. Above the plate tracks exactly. x-axis movement is tracked exactly.

Animation of ghost and dragged item occurs such that they arrive at their cells at same time.

If left plate is full, can still drag out of right panel, but items will always fly back to panels.

1 and -1 (or x and -x) combined to 0, which then fades ala Expression Exchange.

x range is [-40,40]
