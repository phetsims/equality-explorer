TODO items for equality-explorer

Solve It! screen
- make view create nodes for any terms that exist initially in the model
- replace the challenge equation view each time the challenge changes (EquationNode.updateEnabled:false)
- fix universal operation control, top/bottom not pickable?
- observe the state of what's on the scale, determine when answer is correct, update score/faceNode/nextButton
- randomize whether the scale shows 'ax + b = mx + n' or 'mx + n = ax + b'

Lock feature, #19
- all related terms must be created/set before startDrag is called
- can this feature be separated from TermCreator and TermDragListener?
- how to detect whether Term came from toolbox or plate, and not snagged while animating?
- who is responsible for creating ghost Term? does it differ for toolbox vs plate?
- who is responsible for creating inverse Term related to ghost term?
- how is interactivity disabled for a ghost TermNode?
- how should ghost and inverse Terms be managed? as fields in an interactive Term?
- how to 'break relationship' between ghost and inverse Terms?

Lock feature scenarios:
- term dragged from toolbox to toolbox, term and ghost return to toolboxes
- term dragged from toolbox to scale, room for term and ghost on scale
- term dragged from toolbox to scale, term's plate is full
- term dragged from toolbox to scale, ghost's plate is full
- term dragged from toolbox to scale, term sums to zero with term on scale, ghost moves to plate
- term dragged from scale to scale, ghost available on scale
- term dragged from scale to scale, ghost requires creating inverse on scale
- term dragged from scale to scale, ghost requires creating inverse on scale, inverse removed from scale
- term dragged from scale to toolbox, ghost available on scale
- term dragged from scale to toolbox, ghost requires creating inverse on scale
- term dragged from scale to toolbox, ghost requires creating inverse on scale, inverse removed from scale
- animate to scale, term's plate has become full, return both to toolbox
- animate to scale, ghost's plate has become full, return both to toolbox

Cleanup
- grunt update-copyright-dates
- review unresolved comments in design document
